# Flight-Prices-ML
Flight Price Prediction using Machine Learning with different Regression Algorithms. The following steps were taken to make the models:- 
1. <b>Data Preprocessing</b>:
Handle missing data by imputing or removing it.
Encode categorical variables like airline names and airport codes.
Convert date and time information into a suitable format.
Normalize or scale numerical features.

1. <b>Feature Engineering</b>:
Extract relevant features that might influence flight delays, such as time of day, day of the week, holidays, etc.
Create new features if necessary, like the time difference between scheduled and actual departure times.

1. <b>Split Data</b>:
Split your dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

1. <b>Model Selection</b>:
Choose regression algorithms suitable for your dataset. Some common choices include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting models.

1. <b>Model Training</b>:
Train your chosen regression model using the training dataset.

1. <b>Model Evaluation</b>:
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set, using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

1. <b>Hyperparameter Tuning</b>:
Fine-tune the hyperparameters of your model to improve performance.

1. <b>Prediction</b>:
Use the trained model to predict flight delays on new data.
